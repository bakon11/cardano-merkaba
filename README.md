## Cardano Merkaba

"Your transformative journey into the Cardano blockchain, where innovation meets spiritual ascension."

## Why the Name Merkaba?

Here, Merkaba transcends its traditional mystical roots, where it was a symbol of divine ascent via Ezekiel's chariot. In this context, it's adopted as a spiritual movement symbolizing the journey into the Cardano blockchain, representing not just technological innovation but also a personal transformation towards enlightenment and balance in the digital age.

## Why Another Project That Might Feel Like a Wallet to Some?
The Cardano Merkaba is build using the PLU-TS Library and is create to run as a stand alone applicaiton in a trustless manner on your own Cardano infrastructure.

And plans on going beyond what any wallet project is doing nowadays on Cardano, and maybe simply become what I always thought Cardano Daedalus wallet could have been.

The plan here is to really embrace decentralization by giving Cardano users a tool where they can not only choose their own infrastructure to access the Cardano Blockchain but also provide them tools to:

- Have Cardano asset (NFT/FT) minting at their fingertips through a friendly UI/UX experience
- Offer full governance capabilities
- Facilitate stake pool operations, and more.

What differentiates this from everyone else is that Cardano Merkaba is aimed to run fully as an Electron app on the user's device (e.g., PC: Windows, Linux, macOS, or any mobile device from Android to iOS).

## Infrastructure and Tools

Cardano Merkaba is being fully developed using - **[**Harmonic Labs PLU-TS Tools**](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/ ) for off-chain and on-chain transaction generation. It allows you to specify your own backend infrastructure and to be a truly decentralized tool for all your Cardano needs, something that most current tools, especially wallets, don't give the ability to do.
